❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function or passed as
arguments.
* ❌ The function lacks explicit parameter definitions, making its behavior unpredictable and prone to errors.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear what inputs it expects.
* ✔️ The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`, providing a clear and predictable output based on the inputs.
